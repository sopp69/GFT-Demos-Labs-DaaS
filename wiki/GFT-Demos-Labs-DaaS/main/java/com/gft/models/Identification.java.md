# Documentation: `Identification` Class

## Overview
The `Identification` class is a simple data structure designed to represent an identification entity. It contains two fields: `id` and `typeId`, which store the identification value and its type, respectively. This class leverages the Lombok library to reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating getter, setter, and constructor methods.

## Class Details

### Package
The class is part of the `com.gft.models` package.

### Annotations
The class uses the following Lombok annotations:
- **`@Getter`**: Automatically generates getter methods for all fields.
- **`@Setter`**: Automatically generates setter methods for all fields.
- **`@AllArgsConstructor`**: Automatically generates a constructor with parameters for all fields.

### Fields
| Field Name | Type   | Description                          |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `id`       | String | Represents the unique identifier.   |
| `typeId`   | String | Represents the type of the identifier. |

### Constructor
The class has a single constructor, generated by Lombok's `@AllArgsConstructor` annotation:
```java
public Identification(String id, String typeId)
```
This constructor initializes both fields (`id` and `typeId`).

## Insights
1. **Lombok Usage**: The use of Lombok annotations significantly reduces boilerplate code, making the class concise and easier to maintain.
2. **Data Structure**: This class is purely a data structure with no additional logic or behavior. It is designed to store and retrieve identification-related data.
3. **Extensibility**: The class can be easily extended to include additional fields or methods if needed in the future.
4. **Encapsulation**: The use of private fields with public getters and setters ensures proper encapsulation, adhering to object-oriented design principles.

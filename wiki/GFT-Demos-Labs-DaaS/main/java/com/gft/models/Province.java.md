## Insights

1. **Purpose**: The `Province` class is designed as a simple data structure to hold information about a province, including its unique identifier and name.

2. **Lombok Usage**: The use of Lombok annotations significantly reduces boilerplate code, making the class concise and easier to maintain.

3. **Constructors**:
   - The `@AllArgsConstructor` annotation provides a constructor to initialize all fields.
   - The `@NoArgsConstructor` annotation provides a default constructor, which is useful for frameworks that require a no-argument constructor (e.g., Hibernate, Jackson).

4. **Encapsulation**: The class ensures proper encapsulation by using private fields and providing public getter and setter methods.

5. **Potential Use Cases**:
   - This class can be used in applications that manage geographical or administrative data.
   - It can serve as a model in APIs, databases, or UI components that deal with provinces.

6. **Extensibility**: The class can be easily extended to include additional fields or methods if more information about a province is required in the future.

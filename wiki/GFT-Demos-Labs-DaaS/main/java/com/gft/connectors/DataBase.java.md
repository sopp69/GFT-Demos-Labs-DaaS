# Documentation: `DataBase` Class

## Overview
The `DataBase` class provides a utility for managing a connection to a MySQL database. It includes methods to establish and close a connection, ensuring that the database connection is handled efficiently and safely. This class uses the Singleton pattern to maintain a single instance of the database connection throughout the application's lifecycle.

## Class: `DataBase`

### Package
`com.gft.connectors`

### Dependencies
- **`java.sql.Connection`**: Represents a connection to the database.
- **`java.sql.DriverManager`**: Used to establish a connection to the database.
- **`java.sql.SQLException`**: Handles SQL-related exceptions.

---

## Methods

### 1. `obtenerConexion()`
#### Description
This method establishes a connection to the MySQL database if it does not already exist. It uses the Singleton pattern to ensure only one connection instance is created.

#### Implementation Details
- **Driver Registration**: Registers the MySQL JDBC driver using `Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver")`.
- **Connection Establishment**: Uses `DriverManager.getConnection()` to connect to the database with the following parameters:
  - **URL**: `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/la_mejor_ddbb`
  - **Username**: `elMejorUsuario`
  - **Password**: `Seguro123`
- **Error Handling**: Catches any exceptions during the connection process and prints the stack trace.

#### Return Value
- Returns a `Connection` object representing the database connection.

#### Usage
```java
Connection connection = DataBase.obtenerConexion();
```

---

### 2. `cerrarConexion()`
#### Description
This method closes the database connection if it is currently open. It ensures proper resource management by releasing the connection when it is no longer needed.

#### Implementation Details
- **Null Check**: Ensures the connection is not `null` before attempting to close it.
- **Connection Closure**: Calls the `close()` method on the `Connection` object.
- **Error Handling**: Catches `SQLException` and prints the error code and message to the console, along with the stack trace.

#### Usage
```java
DataBase.cerrarConexion();
```

## Insights

### Design Pattern
- **Singleton Pattern**: The `DataBase` class ensures that only one instance of the database connection is created and reused throughout the application. This is achieved by maintaining a static `Connection` object (`conexion`).

### Database Configuration
- **Database URL**: `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/la_mejor_ddbb`
- **Username**: `elMejorUsuario`
- **Password**: `Seguro123`
- **Driver**: `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`

### Error Handling
- The class uses basic error handling by printing stack traces and error messages to the console. However, this approach may not be suitable for production environments where logging frameworks (e.g., SLF4J, Log4j) are preferred.

### Thread Safety
- The current implementation is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access the `obtenerConexion()` method simultaneously, it may lead to race conditions. Consider synchronizing the method or using a thread-safe approach to ensure proper behavior in multi-threaded environments.

### Security Concerns
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: The database credentials (`username` and `password`) are hardcoded in the class. This is a potential security risk. It is recommended to externalize these credentials using environment variables, configuration files, or a secure secrets management system.

### Resource Management
- The `cerrarConexion()` method ensures that the database connection is properly closed, preventing resource leaks. However, it is the developer's responsibility to call this method when the connection is no longer needed.

## Example Usage

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Obtain a connection
        Connection connection = DataBase.obtenerConexion();

        // Perform database operations here...

        // Close the connection
        DataBase.cerrarConexion();
    }
}
```

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Thread Safety**: Make the `obtenerConexion()` method thread-safe to handle concurrent access.
2. **Externalize Configuration**: Move database credentials and connection details to a secure configuration file or environment variables.
3. **Logging Framework**: Replace `System.err` and `e.printStackTrace()` with a proper logging framework for better error tracking and debugging.
4. **Connection Pooling**: Consider using a connection pooling library (e.g., HikariCP) for better performance and resource management.

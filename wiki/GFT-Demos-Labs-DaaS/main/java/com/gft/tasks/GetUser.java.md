# Documentation: `GetUser.java`

## Overview
The `GetUser` class is part of the `com.gft.tasks` package and is designed to interact with a database to retrieve user information based on a given user ID. It also includes functionality to set up a `User` object with predefined data. The class relies on external models (`User`, `Identification`, `Address`) and a database connector (`DataBase`) for its operations.

|-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `noUser`             | `String`   | Placeholder for a user-related string, though its purpose is not defined.  |
| `wait`               | `Integer`  | Placeholder for an integer value, though its purpose is not defined.       |
| `user`               | `User`     | Represents a user object, initialized in the `SETUserIngfo` method.        |
| `consultUserById`    | `String`   | SQL query template to fetch user data by ID from the `users` table.        |

### Methods

#### `getInfoUser(String id)`
- **Description**: Retrieves user information from the database using the provided user ID.
- **Parameters**:
  - `id` (`String`): The ID of the user to be queried.
- **Returns**:
  - `String`: The result of the SQL query execution, which is the user data fetched from the database.
- **Throws**:
  - `SQLException`: If there is an issue with database connectivity or query execution.
- **Logic**:
  - Establishes a connection to the database using the `DataBase` connector.
  - Executes the SQL query (`consultUserById`) with the provided user ID.
  - Returns the result of the query execution.

#### `SETUserIngfo()`
- **Description**: Initializes the `user` object with predefined data, including names, surnames, birthday, gender, and identification details.
- **Logic**:
  - Parses a hardcoded date string (`"10/10/2010"`) into a `Date` object using `SimpleDateFormat`.
  - Creates an `Identification` object and sets its type to `"Passport"`.
  - Initializes the `user` object with predefined values for names, surnames, birthday, gender, and identification.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Catches any exceptions during date parsing or object initialization and prints the stack trace.

## Insights

### Strengths
1. **Database Interaction**: The class provides a mechanism to query user data from a database using a dynamic SQL query.
2. **Object Initialization**: The `SETUserIngfo` method demonstrates how to initialize a `User` object with predefined values, which can be useful for testing or default configurations.

### Weaknesses
1. **Hardcoded Values**: The `SETUserIngfo` method uses hardcoded values for the `User` object, which limits its flexibility and scalability.
2. **Error Handling**: The exception handling in `SETUserIngfo` only prints the stack trace, which may not be sufficient for production environments.
3. **Database Connection**: The `getInfoUser` method assumes the `DataBase` connector is properly initialized, but does not handle cases where it might be `null`.
4. **Naming Conventions**: The method name `SETUserIngfo` does not follow standard naming conventions and contains a typo (`Ingfo` instead of `Info`).

### Recommendations
1. **Dynamic Data**: Replace hardcoded values in `SETUserIngfo` with dynamic inputs or configuration files.
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms, such as logging frameworks or custom exception classes.
3. **Validation**: Add validation checks for the `DataBase` connector and input parameters in `getInfoUser`.
4. **Refactor Naming**: Rename `SETUserIngfo` to `setUserInfo` for better readability and adherence to naming conventions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency Name       | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `com.gft.connectors.DataBase` | Provides database connectivity and query execution functionality.   |
| `com.gft.models.User`         | Represents a user entity with attributes like names, birthday, etc. |
| `com.gft.models.Identification` | Represents identification details for a user.                     |
| `com.gft.models.Address`      | Represents address details for a user (not utilized in this class). |

## SQL Query
| Query Name           | Query Template                                      | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `consultUserById`    | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE idUser = %s`             | Fetches user data from the `users` table by ID. |

## Potential Improvements
1. **Parameterization**: Use prepared statements instead of string formatting for SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests for both methods to ensure correctness and reliability.
3. **Documentation**: Include JavaDoc comments for better inline documentation.

# Documentation: `NotIsEquals` Class

## Overview
The `NotIsEquals` class is a custom exception that extends the `AssertionError` class. It is designed to represent a specific type of assertion error, typically used in scenarios where a condition of equality is expected but not met. This class allows for the inclusion of a custom error message and a root cause (`Throwable`) to provide more context about the failure.

---

## Class Details

### Package
`com.gft.exceptions`

### Class Declaration
```java
public class NotIsEquals extends AssertionError
```

The `NotIsEquals` class inherits from `AssertionError`, which is part of the Java standard library. This makes it suitable for use in testing or validation scenarios where failed assertions need to be explicitly handled.

## Fields

| Modifier and Type       | Field Name         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `private static final`  | `long serialVersionUID` | A unique identifier for serialization, ensuring compatibility during deserialization. |

## Constructor

### `NotIsEquals(String message, Throwable cause)`
This constructor initializes a new instance of the `NotIsEquals` class with a custom error message and a root cause.

#### Parameters:
| Parameter Name | Type       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `message`      | `String`   | A descriptive message explaining the assertion failure.                    |
| `cause`        | `Throwable`| The underlying cause of the assertion failure, providing additional context.|

#### Usage:
This constructor is typically used to create an instance of the `NotIsEquals` exception when an equality assertion fails, and additional context (such as a stack trace or another exception) needs to be provided.

## Insights

1. **Purpose**: The `NotIsEquals` class is specifically tailored for scenarios where equality assertions fail. It provides a structured way to handle such failures with detailed error messages and root causes.

2. **Serialization**: The inclusion of the `serialVersionUID` field ensures that instances of this class can be serialized and deserialized reliably, which is particularly useful in distributed systems or when persisting exception objects.

3. **Extensibility**: By extending `AssertionError`, this class integrates seamlessly with Java's assertion mechanism, making it a natural choice for use in testing frameworks or custom validation logic.

4. **Error Context**: The ability to pass a `Throwable` as the cause allows developers to chain exceptions, making debugging easier by preserving the original stack trace and error context.

5. **Use Case**: This class is likely intended for use in custom testing frameworks or validation libraries where equality checks are a critical part of the logic.
